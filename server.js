    			Feminism is an interdisciplinary approach to issues of equality and equity based on gender,<br> 
    			gender expression, gender identity, sex, and sexuality as understood through social theories<br> 
    			and political activism. Historically, feminism has evolved from the critical examination of<br> 
    			inequality between the sexes to a more nuanced focus on the social and performative constructions<br> 
    			of gender and sexuality. 
    		</p>

                alert("Introduction to Feminism.");
            </script>
    		<p class='first'>
    			Feminist theory now aims to interrogate inequalities and inequities along the intersectional lines<br> 
    			of ability, class, gender, race, sex, and sexuality, and feminists seek to effect change in areas where<br> 
    			these intersectionalities create power inequity. Intellectual and academic discussion of these inequities<br> 
    			allows our students to go into the world aware of injustices and to work toward changing unhealthy<br> 
    			dynamics in any scenario.
    		</p>
    		<p class='first'>
    			Feminist political activists campaign in areas such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, fairness<br>, 
    			social justice, and workplace issues such as family medical leave, equal pay, and sexual harassment<br> 
    			and discrimination. 
    		</p>
    		<p class='first'>
    			Anytime stereotyping, objectification, infringements of human rights, or intersectional oppression occurs,<br> 
    			it's a <strong>Feminist</strong> issue.
