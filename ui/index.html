	<div id="content">We Indians love to eat as well as feed others.

	For this very reason, every time we have a function or a party we ensure that there's plenty of food around.<br>
	After all the eating, drinking and merriment, we often end up with lot of leftover food. While some of it can<br> 
	be packed off to friends and relatives, most of it goes to waste. Often, after a big party at home is over, we wonder<br> 
	what to do with the food.

	We people, take the Excess food from individuals, weddings, restuarants,, corporate offices etc and give it to<br> 
	people who really need .We ensure it reaches the underprivilleged.
