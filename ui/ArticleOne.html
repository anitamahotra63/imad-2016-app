		<b>What is Feminism?</b>
	</div>
	<div id="content">
		<p>
			Feminism is an interdisciplinary approach to issues of equality and equity based on gender,<br> 
			gender expression, gender identity, sex, and sexuality as understood through social theories<br> 
			and political activism. Historically, feminism has evolved from the critical examination of<br> 
			inequality between the sexes to a more nuanced focus on the social and performative constructions<br> 
			of gender and sexuality. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Feminist theory now aims to interrogate inequalities and inequities along the intersectional lines<br> 
			of ability, class, gender, race, sex, and sexuality, and feminists seek to effect change in areas where<br> 
			these intersectionalities create power inequity. Intellectual and academic discussion of these inequities<br> 
			allows our students to go into the world aware of injustices and to work toward changing unhealthy<br> 
			dynamics in any scenario.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feminist political activists campaign in areas such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, fairness<br>, 
			social justice, and workplace issues such as family medical leave, equal pay, and sexual harassment<br> 
			and discrimination. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Anytime stereotyping, objectification, infringements of human rights, or intersectional oppression occurs,<br> 
			it's a <strong>Feminist</strong> issue.
