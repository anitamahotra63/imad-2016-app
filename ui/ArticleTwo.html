			Motivated by the unequal pay she received in the start of her broadcasting career, Oprah set out to start her own television show and from there built an empire catering to helping women grow, develop and thrive, "I never did consider or call myself a feminist, but I don't think you can really be a woman in this world and not be." She has since developed the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa, the Oprah Winfrey Network and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.
